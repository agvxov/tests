Write a parser that accepts an arbitrary long string.
The valid keywords are:
    Head
    Circle
    Square
    Tail
The following input sequences should yield the following outputs:
    HeadCircleTail          -> 1
    HeadSquareTail          -> 2
    HeadSquareTailSquare    -> 3
Multiple inputs can be chained together in the input. E.g.:
    HeadCircleTailHeadSquareTailSquare  -> 13
Invalid input shall be rejected.
