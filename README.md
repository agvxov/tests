# Public tests
I keep *tests* here.
These could range from trivial examples, through complex edge-cases, to experimental ideas.
If I have code without a place in the world, it will end up here.

Storing even the most trivial of examples used to make a lot more sense before AI.
Since AI, one can generate those.
I do not upload AI code.

Ideas I abandon also come to die here.
